# üì¶ Adventure Game Project

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This project is for my university work.

It is an adventure game in which the user navigates a series of rooms to find a golden key.

Features include: Functions for game mechanics, such as moving between rooms, picking up items, and checking the inventory.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Objectives

Game Requirements

    Create a Python-based text adventure game where the player navigates a series of rooms to locate a mythical Golden Key.
    The game should include:
        A map or structure for rooms (e.g., represented as a dictionary where each room links to adjacent rooms).
        Descriptions of each room and options for the player‚Äôs actions (e.g., ‚ÄúGo north,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake key‚Äù).
        A tracking system for items the player collects (e.g., a list of inventory items).
        Functions for game mechanics, such as moving between rooms, picking up items, and checking the inventory.
    Include conditions that make the game challenging, such as limited moves, hidden traps, or a maze structure.

Game Features

    Dynamic Room Interaction: Create at least five rooms with unique descriptions and interactions.
    Player Inventory: Allow players to collect and use items, with some items potentially aiding in the quest for the Golden Key.
    Victory Condition: Design the game to end when the player successfully finds the Golden Key, with a congratulatory message.

Debugging and Testing

    Implement debugging techniques to ensure the game runs smoothly and check for edge cases (e.g., invalid moves or empty inventory).
    Document your testing process, explaining how you identified and resolved any issues.

Submission Requirements

    Submit the Python code, organised with clear comments explaining each function.
    Provide a short description (250 words) of the game‚Äôs design, including the structure of the game world and key functions.
    Include sample gameplay demonstrating the main mechanics and successful completion.
